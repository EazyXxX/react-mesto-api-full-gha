# Mesto project

## What is this project about?

Initially, this service was conceived as a place where you can upload photos of various attractions, but this SPA actually has more of a fun potential. You are free to post whatever you want there in the form of virtual cards - and other people may look at it (or maybe even give you a fat like).

Development tools I used: React, NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB.
